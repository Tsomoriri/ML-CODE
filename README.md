# ML-CODE
A roadmap of tests towards mastering Machine 

# Goal: Become a top-tier ML Engineer with deep expertise in core libraries (Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, PyTorch), MLOps tools (Dask, Airflow, MLflow), and model inference.

# Methodology:

-    Isolation: Use a plain text editor (like Sublime Text, VS Code in basic mode, Notepad++, Vim, Emacs) without AI assistants, extensive auto-complete, or inline documentation.
-    Reference, then Memorize: When stuck, consult the official documentation only. Read it thoroughly, understand the classes, methods, and key arguments, then close the documentation and implement from memory. Repeat until it sticks.

-    Build Incrementally: Start with basics and layer complexity. Implement simpler versions before tackling complex ones.
